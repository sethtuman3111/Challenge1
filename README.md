Introduction:
Our client – Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. – would like us to create a landing page with brief descriptions that highlight their Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.  They would also like us to include a section outlining the benefits of using Horiseon which include Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management.

https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram 

Installation
Download the data and images fromGithub  https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram into VSCode by using GitBash.  Edit both the Index and CCS style sheets in VSCode.   Execute and launch the program in Chrome.   
Configuration:
The client would like codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.  We need to locate the source code and find semantic HTML elements.   The HTML elements should follow a logical structure independent of styling and position.  Image elements should also have alt attributes.   Heading attributes should fall in sequential order.   The Title element should have a concise descriptive title.
